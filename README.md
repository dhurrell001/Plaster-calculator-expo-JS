##Plaster Calculator App

This is my first mobile app, built using JavaScript and React Native (via Expo) and now live on the Apple App Store.

The app helps users estimate how much plaster they’ll need for a given area. Users enter width, length, thickness, and optional contingency values,
and the app calculates the total plaster required in kg, and even the number of bags needed.

It’s designed specifically for tradespeople — like myself, a former plasterer — with a clean, intuitive interface and mobile-first design.

Key features include:

  Real-time calculations based on user input

  Support for contingency percentage

  Results displayed in an easy-to-read format

  Native tabbed navigation (Calculator, Instructions, About)

I developed this app to solve a real-world problem I faced daily on-site — and now it’s helping others do the same.
This project reflects both my career transition from trades to tech and my growing skills in React Native, state management, and UI design.
